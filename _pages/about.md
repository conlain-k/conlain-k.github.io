## About Me

I am currently a PhD Candidate advised by [Dr. Surya Kalidindi](https://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/kalidindi). My research explores the intersections of traditional numerical methods and machine learning and is applied to materials informatics and discovery. I started research as an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin - Madison where I worked with [Dr. Dan Negrut](https://sbel.wisc.edu/negrut-dan/) writing GPU granular dynamics solvers for multiphysics simulations.
